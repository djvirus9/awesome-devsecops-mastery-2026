# Secure CI Guidelines

- Pin action versions and use trusted sources ([GitHub Actions security](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions))
- Use least-privilege permissions
- Isolate secrets and avoid logging sensitive output
- Fail closed on security checks
- Store SBOMs and signatures as build artifacts
