# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately so we can resolve them before disclosure.

- Contact: open a GitHub Security Advisory or email the maintainer listed in `CODEOWNERS`.
- Do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities.

## What to Include

- Summary and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions or commits
- Proof of concept (if available)
- Suggested remediation (if known)

## Response SLA

We aim to triage reports within **72 hours** and provide a remediation plan or mitigation timeline.

## Safe Harbor

We support good-faith security research consistent with this policy. We will not pursue legal action for
reports that avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service disruption.

## Disclosure Guidance

Please allow a reasonable remediation window before public disclosure. We will coordinate timelines and
credit where appropriate.
